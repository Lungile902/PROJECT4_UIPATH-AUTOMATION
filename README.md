# PROJECT4_UIPATH-AUTOMATION

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Poject 4 focuses on testing the web application. This kind of testing is classified as UAT (user acceptance testing), which primarily focuses on testing the web application output which is expected bfy the user. The User Acceptance Testing in most instances of development life cycle is done manually. Subsequently, it mostly relies on human interaction for the test to be conducted. Although, recently with the new technology developed, testing can also be done automatically. Robotic Process Automation can conduct user acceptance testing without the need of human interaction. Its functionâ€™s the same way as the human would. Thus, minimising effort and time in user acceptance testing. Therefore, RPA should be deployed in this project in testing the previous website that was created in project 3.
